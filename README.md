This repository contains the IPython notebooks and data files for various projects. 

If  there are data files needed, they are included in the folders for those projects otherwise the 
data will be pulled from the web.  The data and graphs are already loaded and the notebook doesn't 
need to be run again in order to see the results. 

Here is a list of currently completed projects:

- **Gene expression**: Using the gene expression data from a microarray experiment and SVD (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality, we find out if there is any correlation between the variability in gene expression and the time between samples.
- **Pollster bias**: HuffPost Pollster data for the 2012 Obama vs Romney Presidential elections is used to see if there is any bias in the pollster data using Monte Carlo simulations. We also use some visualizations to observe the variations across various polls and between various pollsters.
