This repository contains the IPython notebooks and data files for various projects. 

If  there are data files needed, they are included in the folders for those projects otherwise the 
data will be pulled from the web.  The data and graphs are already loaded and the notebook doesn't 
need to be run again in order to see the results. 

The description for the projects and nbviewer links to IPython notebooks are available <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/kzg126/#work" target="_blank">here</a>
