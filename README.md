This repository contains the IPython notebooks and data files for various projects. 

If  there are data files needed, they are included in the folders for those projects otherwise the 
data will be pulled from the web.  The data and graphs are already loaded and the notebook doesn't 
need to be run again in order to see the results. 

Here is a list of currently completed projects:

- Gene expression: We use gene expression data from a microarray experiment. We use SVD (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality and analyze if the variability in gene expression has any correlations with the time between samples.
- Pollster bias: We use HuffPost Pollster data for the 2012 Obama vs Romney Presidential elections too see if there is any bias in the pollster data using Monte Carlo simulations. We also use some visualizations to observe the variations across various polls and between various pollsters.
